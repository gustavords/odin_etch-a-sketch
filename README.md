# odin_etch-a-sketch

WELCOME to my Etch-a-Sketch!
Its EVA01 themed! (Its a robot manga from an anime called Neon Genesis Evangelion[NGE])
There might still be some issues, im working on it :)

Issues as of JUN30, 2022:

 - Issue:mouse doesnt actually "paint" the cell clicked on
 //TODO:figure out how to add an event for the initial click, but carry on to other events

 - Issue: .clientHeight work in console but not from script( returns 0)
 //TODO:Figure out why --console.log("grid height: " + grid.clientHeight);--doesn't work

 - Issue: feels slow clunky and some events arent really captured
 //TODO: smooth it out

 - Issue: when clicking the colour option, it doesnt switch into it like the rainbow and erae modes do
 //TODO: add the switch functionality to colour button

Future Add Ons:
 - Save drawing button!
 - resize and not loose drawing!
