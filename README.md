will come back to this!!
Issues to be FIXED:
- Grid resizing, its its not exactly right, but its taken 2 days for this and I need to move on.
- Toggle rainbow button works, but you can't toggle in and out without the grid reloading and your hover dissapearing
- the presention is god awful, this page needs some design
- MAJOR functionality, couldn't figure out how to hold and drag action with mousedown and hover combined, got them to work seperetly but not together
